# Image_Compression_with_K-Means_Clustering
This is a project-based course. 
# Course Objectives
In this course, there are three learning objectives:
1. Explain the steps involved in k-means clustering.
2. Apply k-means clustering with scikit-learn and Python to compress images.
3. Create interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter widgets

By the end of this course,I was able to apply the k-means clustering algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to build an image compression application with interactive controls.
