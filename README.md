# Image_Compression_with_K-Means_Clustering
The clustering algorithm is an unsupervised method, where the input is not a labeled one and problem solving is based on the experience that the algorithm gains out of solving similar problems as a training schedule.
#
The whole project is divided into three objectives:
1. Explain the steps involved in k-means clustering.
2. Apply k-means clustering with scikit-learn and Python to compress images.
3. Create interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter widgets
