# Image_Compression_with_K-Means_Clustering
The clustering algorithm is an unsupervised method where the input is not labeled and problem solving is based on the experience that the algorithm gains from solving similar problems as a training schedule.
#
The whole project is divided into three objectives:
1. Explain the steps involved in k-means clustering.
2. Apply k-means clustering with scikit-learn and Python to compress images.
3. Create interactive GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter widgets
# Libraries
scikit-learn,Numpy, Python, and Jupyter Widgets k-means clustering algorithm
# project development
 1.  pre-processingthe high-resolution image data for k-means clustering,
 2.  conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
 3.  data visualization for finding out the center
 4.  time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress images, and
5. leverage the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.
